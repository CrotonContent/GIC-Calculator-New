GIC laddering is a strategic approach to GIC investing that can help you maximize returns while maintaining flexibility. This guide explains how to implement this strategy effectively.

## What is GIC Laddering?

GIC laddering involves buying multiple GICs with different maturity dates. This strategy provides regular access to your money while taking advantage of longer-term rates.

## Benefits of GIC Laddering

1. **Regular Access to Funds**: As each GIC matures, you have the option to reinvest or use the funds
2. **Interest Rate Risk Management**: Reduces the risk of locking in all your money at low rates
3. **Flexibility**: Combines the higher rates of longer terms with the liquidity of shorter terms

## How to Build a GIC Ladder

### 1. Determine Your Investment Amount

Start by deciding how much you want to invest in total. For example, if you have $25,000, you might split it into five $5,000 portions.

### 2. Choose Your Terms

Spread your investment across different terms. A common approach is:
- 1-year GIC: $5,000
- 2-year GIC: $5,000
- 3-year GIC: $5,000
- 4-year GIC: $5,000
- 5-year GIC: $5,000

### 3. Reinvest at Maturity

As each GIC matures, reinvest in a new 5-year GIC to maintain the ladder.

## Example Returns

Using current rates (as of March 2024):
- 1-year: 4.75%
- 2-year: 4.85%
- 3-year: 4.90%
- 4-year: 4.95%
- 5-year: 5.00%

This strategy provides an effective way to manage your GIC portfolio while optimizing returns.
